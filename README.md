### ChoppedUp
What's more satisfying than killing someone in PvP? Killing somene in PvP then seeing how many pieces they were chopped up into!

With this Addon you will see a message in chat if you land a killing blow on an enemy player (or NPC if enabled) telling you exactly how many pieces they were chopped up into.
